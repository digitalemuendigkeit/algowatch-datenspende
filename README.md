# algowatch-datenspende
  
We provide an adjusted k-means algorithm suited for clustering ranked lists such as search engine result lists. As a distance measure, we use the rank-biased overlap metric by Webber, Moffat, & Zobel (2010). We test the algorithm using the datenspende_btw17 dataset by Algorithm Watch.  
  
Detailed documentation is following soon.
